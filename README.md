The following HTML were used to scrape the data 

* https://mars.nasa.gov/news/?page=0&per_page=40&order=publish_date+desc%2Ccreated_at+desc&search=&category=19%2C165%2C184%2C204&blank_scope=Latest
* https://space-facts.com/mars/
* https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars
